This game is all about exploring planets in your surrounding solar system of Alpha Centarui IV.
There are some planets that are pretty useless, just sucking up fuel to travel to. There are others
that have resources available, but there are unknown perils. Additionally, flying around space isn't
exactly safe either! There is an opportunity for disasters to happen mid flight. A nav failure could occur,
resulting in lost fuel. A fire could occur, which results in a loss of crew.
An asteroid could strike, resulting in both lost fuel and crew. There are some nuances built in. 
Exploration is key! There are two ship classes. The scout class has a low amount of fuel and crew, and is designed
to make the game more difficult. The freighter class ship has a much high fuel and crew count, which makes the game
much, much easier. 

To win, explore all of the planets! Loss occurs whenever your ship runs out of fuel, or you run out of crew.

In the event of a win, a file will be output, how many times you went to a planet, and how much fuel and crew remained afterward.
